# Testing Guide for KeyPass

## Overview

KeyPass implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and maintainability of the codebase, including **wallet and account selection** functionality. The testing suite combines unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, utilizing Jest as the primary testing framework. The test suite validates both core functionality and the new interactive wallet selection features.

## ðŸ†• New Wallet Selection Testing

### **Mock Wallet Implementations**

For testing wallet selection without requiring actual wallet extensions:

```typescript
// Mock wallet for testing
class MockWalletAdapter implements WalletAdapter {
  private accounts: WalletAccount[] = [
    {
      address: '5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY',
      name: 'Test Account 1',
      source: 'polkadot-js',
      chainType: 'polkadot',
      balance: '10.5'
    },
    {
      address: '5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty',
      name: 'Test Account 2', 
      source: 'polkadot-js',
      chainType: 'polkadot',
      balance: '25.0'
    }
  ];

  async enable(): Promise<void> {
    // Mock enable
  }

  async getAccounts(): Promise<WalletAccount[]> {
    return this.accounts;
  }

  async signMessage(message: string): Promise<string> {
    return '0x' + 'mock_signature'.repeat(8);
  }

  getWalletInfo() {
    return {
      id: 'mock-wallet' as WalletId,
      name: 'Mock Wallet',
      version: '1.0.0'
    };
  }

  // ... other required methods
}
```

### **Testing Wallet Selection Flow**

```typescript
import { selectWallet, selectAccount } from '@keypass/login-sdk';

describe('Wallet Selection', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup mock wallets
    global.window.injectedWeb3 = {
      'polkadot-js': {
        enable: jest.fn(),
        accounts: {
          get: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockAccounts)
        }
      }
    };
  });

  test('should display available wallets', async () => {
    const wallets = await getAvailableWallets('polkadot');
    
    expect(wallets).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(wallets[0].name).toBe('Polkadot.js Extension');
    expect(wallets[0].isInstalled).toBe(true);
  });

  test('should handle wallet selection', async () => {
    const result = await selectWallet({
      chainType: 'polkadot',
      showAccountSelection: false
    });

    expect(result.walletInfo.name).toBe('Polkadot.js Extension');
    expect(result.chainType).toBe('polkadot');
  });

  test('should handle account selection', async () => {
    const mockWallet = new MockWalletAdapter();
    const selectedAccount = await selectAccount(mockWallet, {
      showBalance: true
    });

    expect(selectedAccount.address).toBeDefined();
    expect(selectedAccount.balance).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Test Structure

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Located in `src/*/__tests__/` directories, these tests focus on individual components:
- Wallet adapters (Polkadot.js, Talisman)
- Account management and selection
- Configuration validation
- DID operations and validation
- Error handling and custom error classes
- Message signing and verification
- Server endpoints and middleware

### Integration Tests
Located in `__tests__/integration/`, these tests verify component interactions:
- Wallet connector integration and adapter selection
- Authentication flow including wallet connection, account selection, and message signing
- Concurrent operations (multiple login attempts and wallet connections)
- Integration between wallet adapters, authentication service, and verification service
- Error handling across component boundaries (wallet not found, user rejection, verification failures)

The integration tests focus on ensuring that different components of the system work together correctly, with particular attention to error cases and concurrent operations.

### End-to-End Tests
Located in `__tests__/e2e/`, these tests validate critical system flows:
- Complete authentication process including wallet connection and message signing
- DID (Decentralized Identifier) creation and resolution
- DID document generation and verification
- Integration between wallet adapters, authentication, and DID services

Note: The current e2e test suite focuses on the core authentication and DID flows. Additional user interaction scenarios and real-world usage patterns may be added in future iterations.


### CI/CD Pipeline

### Docker Environment
For running tests in a Docker environment, we provide a comprehensive setup that ensures consistent test execution across different environments. This includes a verification server, test runner with browser testing capabilities, and proper test isolation.

For detailed instructions on:
- Docker setup and configuration
- Available test commands
- Test results handling
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices

Please refer to the [Docker Testing Guide](docs/docker-testing.md).

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
The Jest setup (`jest.config.js`) includes:
- TypeScript support via `ts-jest` preset
- JSDOM test environment for browser API simulation
- Module path alias `@/` mapping to `src/`
- Custom setup file (`jest.setup.js`) for test environment preparation
- Test path ignore patterns for `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.d.ts` files
- Isolated modules for TypeScript transformation

### Test Environment
The test environment (`jest.setup.js`) provides:
- TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills (required for JSDOM)
- Mock implementation of `window.injectedWeb3` for wallet testing


## Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline uses GitHub Actions to run tests in a Docker environment:

1. **Test Execution**
   - Runs on every push to main and pull requests
   - Uses Docker containers for consistent test environment
   - Runs all test suites (unit, integration, wallet connector)
   - Generates coverage reports in `test-results/coverage`

2. **Test Environment**
   - Uses Node.js 20 in Docker containers
   - Includes verification server and test runner containers
   - Mounts test results directory for artifact collection
   - Uses GitHub Actions for container orchestration

3. **Test Results**
   - Test results are stored in `test-results` directory
   - Coverage reports are generated using Jest
   - Results are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Test logs are available in GitHub Actions workflow

For detailed CI configuration, see the [Docker Testing Guide](docs/docker-testing.md).

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing test structure
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions
3. Include appropriate test coverage
4. Document any new testing patterns
5. Update this guide if introducing new testing approaches
6. Add wallet-specific test cases
7. Include DID-related test scenarios
8. Test error handling paths
9. Verify concurrent operations
10. Add appropriate timeouts

Remember: Good tests are as important as the code they test. They provide confidence in The implementation and help prevent regressions, especially in critical wallet authentication and DID operations.
