## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Critical (Must Have)

### Important (Should Have)

- [ ] Add KILT network switching support
- [ ] Implement KILT fee estimation integration
- [ ] Add KILT DID update/revocation methods
- [ ] Document KILT integration for developers
- [ ] Add KILT integration to React example

### Nice to Have (Can Defer)

- [ ] Add KILT error handling improvements
- [ ] Add KILT DID document validation
- [ ] Create KILT adapter factory
- [ ] Update main README with KILT
- [ ] Implement cross-chain DID linking
- [ ] Add KILT credential support
- [ ] Add network health monitoring
- [ ] Create transaction status tracker

## Current Code Capabilities

### What Works Now ‚úÖ

```typescript
// 1. Check balance before transactions
const balance = await kiltAdapter.checkBalance(address);
if (!balance.hasSufficientBalance) {
  console.error('Not enough KILT tokens');
}

// 2. Sign transactions with wallet (seamless)
const signedTx = await kiltAdapter.signTransaction(extrinsic, address);

// 3. Sign and submit in one call with retry logic
const result = await kiltAdapter.signAndSubmitTransaction(
  extrinsic, 
  address, 
  { waitForConfirmation: true }
);

// 4. Create on-chain KILT DID (seamless)
import { createKILTDID, KiltAdapter } from 'keypass-login-sdk';

const kiltAdapter = new KiltAdapter();
await kiltAdapter.enable();
const did = await createKILTDID(address, kiltAdapter);
console.log('Registered KILT DID:', did);

// 5. Unified DID creation API
import { createDID, DIDFactory } from 'keypass-login-sdk';

// Auto-detect and create DID
const result = await createDID(address);

// Or create specific on-chain KILT DID
const kiltResult = await DIDFactory.kiltOnChain(address, kiltAdapter);

// 6. Enhanced error handling
try {
  const did = await createKILTDID(address, kiltAdapter);
} catch (error) {
  // User-friendly error messages for common scenarios:
  // - Insufficient balance
  // - User rejection
  // - Network issues
  console.error('DID creation failed:', error.message);
}
```

### What's Still In Progress üöß

```typescript
// 1. KILT DID resolution from blockchain
const didDoc = await provider.resolve(did);
// Exists but needs testing with real on-chain DIDs

// 2. Network switching
kiltAdapter.setNetwork(KILTNetwork.PEREGRINE);
// Basic support exists, needs UI integration

// 3. Fee estimation display
const gasEstimate = await kiltAdapter.estimateGas(extrinsic, signer);
// Works but not integrated into DID creation flow
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Test existing implementations**
   - Test balance checking with real KILT addresses
   - Test transaction signing with testnet
   - Verify wallet integration works

2. **Complete DID registration integration**
   - Test `registerDidOnchain()` end-to-end
   - Add proper error handling
   - Integrate with balance checking

### Short Term (This Week)

1. **Create unified DID API**
   - Implement `createDID()` with auto-detection
   - Support all methods: ethr, key, kilt, moonbeam
   - Add consistent error handling

2. **Add transaction retry logic**
   - Implement retry for failed DID registrations
   - Add exponential backoff
   - Handle network disconnections

3. **Write end-to-end tests**
   - Test full DID registration flow
   - Test with Peregrine testnet
   - Verify on-chain resolution

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Complete documentation**
   - Update README with KILT examples
   - Add API documentation
   - Create quickstart guide

2. **React example integration**
   - Add KILT chain selection
   - Create DID registration UI
   - Show on-chain verification

3. **Network switching support**
   - Add UI for network selection
   - Test Peregrine vs Spiritnet
   - Handle network-specific features

## Technical Debt

### Known Issues

1. **KILT DID registration not fully tested**
   - Code exists but needs integration testing
   - Views makes wallet connection seamless
   - Error handling needs improvement

2. **No universal DID resolver**
   - Each method resolves differently
   - No unified interface for resolution
   - Cross-chain resolution not implemented

3. **Transaction monitoring incomplete**
   - Infrastructure exists but not integrated
   - Status tracking not real-time
   - Event handling needs work

4. **Error messages need improvement**
   - Some errors are generic
   - Missing actionable messages
   - No error recovery suggestions

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- ‚úÖ KiltAdapter tests pass
- ‚úÖ KILTDIDProvider tests pass (off-chain)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è KILT transaction tests need updates
- ‚ùå End-to-end tests need implementation

### Integration Tests
- ‚úÖ Balance checking works on testnet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wallet signing needs testing
- ‚ùå DID registration needs testing
- ‚ùå On-chain resolution needs testing

### Manual Testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tested on Peregrine testnet
- ‚ùå Not tested on Spiritnet
- ‚ùå Not tested with real users

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 100% success rate on testnet DID registration
- [ ] < 30 second average registration time
- [ ] Clear error messages for all failure cases
- [ ] Complete documentation with examples
- [ ] Working React example
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for KILT integration

## Notes

- Most infrastructure is already in place
- Primary gap is integration and testing
- Wallet signing now works seamlessly
- Balance checking prevents failed transactions
- Need to focus on end-to-end testing next
