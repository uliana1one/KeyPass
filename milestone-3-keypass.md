**Context**

This milestone completes the KeyPass Identity Platform by delivering the production-ready Dev Portal, comprehensive SBT implementation, and partner testing capabilities. The platform now provides a complete self-sovereign identity solution with live demos, published SDK, and real-world integration opportunities. This milestone transforms KeyPass from a prototype into a production-ready platform that educational institutions and Polkadot ecosystem projects can immediately integrate.

The delivery includes a fully deployed demo site, published npm package (`keypass-login-sdk`), comprehensive SBT (Soulbound Token) functionality, and active partnership discussions with Polkadot educational platforms. The platform demonstrates seamless wallet-based authentication, DID creation, credential management, and zero-knowledge proofs, establishing KeyPass as the go-to identity solution for the Polkadot ecosystem.
