## What to Say During Demo

### Opening
"KeyPass is a self-sovereign login system that replaces 'Sign in with Google' using crypto wallets and DIDs. Let me show you how it works."

### During Wallet Login
"Users can log in using their existing crypto wallet - no email or password needed. We support Polkadot and Ethereum wallets."

### During DID Creation
"This creates a real DID on the KILT blockchain - not just locally, but as an actual transaction. You can see the transaction hash here."

### During Explorer Verification
"Here's the transaction on the blockchain explorer. This proves the DID is actually on-chain, not a simulation."

### Closing
"Users own their identity, it works across multiple chains, and it's production-ready today."

## Potential Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Wallet not connecting | Ensure extension installed |
| No accounts shown | Add account to extension first |
| Transaction fails | Need testnet tokens (KILT/DEV) |
| Build errors | Run `npm install` in boilerplate |

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Demo runs without errors
- âœ… Wallet connects successfully
- âœ… DID created on-chain
- âœ… Transaction visible on explorer
- âœ… Professional UI/UX

## After Demo

- Show PROJECT_DELIVERY.md for technical details
- Show GitHub repo for code review
- Show npm package: `keypass-login-sdk`
- Mention 86% test coverage
