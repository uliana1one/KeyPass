   - Enter minimum age (e.g., 18)
   - Click "Generate"
   - Wait for proof generation

**What you'll see:**
- Proof type: Semaphore
- Circuit: age-verification
- Public signals count
- Verification status: âœ… Valid
- Privacy indicator: âœ… Age verified without revealing exact age

**For student credential:**

1. **Prove Student Status**
   - Click "Prove Student Status"
   - Select SBT token (if available)
   - Click "Generate"
   - Wait for proof generation

**What you'll see:**

- Insufficient balance for gas
- Network mismatch
- Transaction timeout

**Solutions:**
- Get testnet tokens from faucet
- Switch to correct network
- Retry transaction

### DID Creation Failed

**Possible issues:**
- DID already exists
- Insufficient KILT balance
- Network congestion

**Solutions:**
- Check if DID already created
- Get KILT tokens
- Wait and retry

### SBT Mint Failed

**Possible issues:**
- Contract not deployed
- Wrong network
- Gas estimation failed

**Solutions:**
- Verify contract address
- Switch to Moonbase Alpha
- Check gas prices

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Testnet Tokens:** Always have extra DEV and KILT tokens for gas
2. **Network Selection:** Ensure wallet is on correct testnet
3. **Patience:** Blockchain transactions take time
4. **Explorer Links:** Use provided links to verify on-chain
5. **Testing:** Try different wallets to compare UX
