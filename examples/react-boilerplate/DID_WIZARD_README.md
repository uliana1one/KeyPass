# DID Creation Wizard Implementation

## Overview

The DID Creation Wizard is a comprehensive interface that allows users to create and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as part of the KeyPass authentication flow. This implementation provides both basic and advanced DID creation options with a step-by-step wizard interface.

## Features

### 🧙‍♂️ Wizard Interface
- **Step-by-step guidance** through DID creation process
- **Progress indicator** showing current step and completion status
- **Responsive design** optimized for both desktop and mobile
- **Error handling** with user-friendly error messages

### 🔑 DID Types
- **Basic DID**: Simple DID for authentication and basic identity verification
- **Advanced DID**: Enhanced DID with custom attributes, service endpoints, and credential readiness

### 🛠️ Advanced Configuration
- **Custom attributes**: Add key-value pairs for additional identity information
- **Service endpoints**: Configure external service references
- **Credential readiness**: Prepare DID for verifiable credential management
- **Purpose specification**: Define the intended use of the DID

### 📋 DID Document Viewer
- **Expandable interface** for viewing DID details
- **Tabbed navigation** (Overview, Document, Verification)
- **Copy-to-clipboard** functionality for DID strings and documents
- **Verification status** display
- **Capability overview** showing enabled features

## Implementation Details

### Components

#### DIDWizard (`src/components/DIDWizard.tsx`)
Main wizard component that orchestrates the DID creation process.

**Props:**
- `walletAddress`: User's wallet address
- `chainType`: 'polkadot' or 'ethereum'
- `accountName`: Display name for the account
- `onComplete`: Callback when DID creation is complete
- `onCancel`: Callback when user cancels the process
- `onBack`: Callback to return to previous step

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic step progression based on DID type selection
- Real-time preview generation
- Form validation and error handling
- Integration with existing authentication flow

#### DIDDocumentViewer (`src/components/DIDDocumentViewer.tsx`)
Component for displaying and managing created DIDs.

**Props:**
- `didCreationResult`: Result from DID creation process
- `did`: The created DID string
- `address`: Associated wallet address
- `chainType`: Blockchain type

**Key Features:**
- Three-tab interface (Overview, Document, Verification)
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Expandable/collapsible interface
- Mobile-responsive design

### Integration Flow

1. **Chain Selection**: User selects Polkadot or Ethereum
2. **Wallet Selection**: User chooses their wallet
3. **Account Selection**: User selects account from wallet
4. **DID Creation Wizard**: NEW - User creates their DID
5. **Authentication**: System authenticates with created DID
6. **Profile Dashboard**: User sees their profile with DID details

### Wizard Steps

#### Step 1: DID Type Selection
- Choose between Basic or Advanced DID
- Visual cards showing features and recommendations
- Clear explanation of differences

#### Step 2: Advanced Configuration (Advanced DID only)
- **Purpose Selection**: Authentication, Professional, Academic, Social, Business, Custom
- **Description**: Optional text description
- **Service Endpoints**: Toggle for external service integration
- **Credential Readiness**: Toggle for verifiable credential support
- **Custom Attributes**: Key-value pairs for additional metadata

#### Step 3: Preview
- **Summary Grid**: Key information about the DID
- **Document Preview**: Full DID document structure
- **Features List**: Enabled capabilities
- **Validation**: Ensure all required fields are complete

#### Step 4: Creation
- **Final Confirmation**: Review configuration
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual feedback during creation
- **Success Handling**: Completion callback to continue authentication

## Styling

### Design System
- **Dark Theme**: Consistent with KeyPass branding
- **Glass Morphism**: Backdrop blur effects and transparency
- **Gradient Accents**: Blue to green gradients for primary actions
- **Responsive Grid**: Flexible layouts for different screen sizes

### Key CSS Classes
- `.did-wizard`: Main wizard container
- `.wizard-progress`: Step indicator and progress bar
- `.did-type-card`: DID type selection cards
- `.did-preview`: Preview section styling
- `.did-document-viewer`: Document viewer container

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```typescript
import { DIDWizard } from './components/DIDWizard';

function MyApp() {
  const handleDIDComplete = (result: DIDCreationResult) => {
    console.log('DID created:', result.did);
    // Continue with authentication
  };

  return (
    <DIDWizard
      walletAddress="5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty"
      chainType="polkadot"
      accountName="My Account"
      onComplete={handleDIDComplete}
      onCancel={() => console.log('Cancelled')}
      onBack={() => console.log('Back')}
    />
  );
}
```

### Document Viewer Integration
```typescript
import { DIDDocumentViewer } from './components/DIDDocumentViewer';

function ProfilePage({ loginResult }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {loginResult.didCreationResult && (
        <DIDDocumentViewer
          didCreationResult={loginResult.didCreationResult}
          did={loginResult.did}
          address={loginResult.address}
          chainType={loginResult.chainType}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Data Structures

### DIDCreationOptions
```typescript
interface DIDCreationOptions {
  type: 'basic' | 'advanced';
  includeServices?: boolean;
  includeCredentials?: boolean;
  customAttributes?: Record<string, string>;
  purpose?: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

### DIDCreationResult
```typescript
interface DIDCreationResult {
  did: string;
  didDocument: any;
  options: DIDCreationOptions;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

## Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support throughout the wizard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators
- **High Contrast**: Sufficient color contrast for readability
- **Responsive Text**: Scalable fonts and layouts

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile Support**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Security Considerations

- **Client-Side Only**: DID creation happens entirely in the browser
- **No Private Key Exposure**: Uses existing wallet connections
- **Deterministic Generation**: DIDs are reproducible from wallet addresses
- **Standard Compliance**: Follows W3C DID Core specification

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and state management
- Form validation and error handling
- User interaction flows
- Data structure validation

### Integration Tests
- Full wizard flow completion
- Authentication integration
- Document viewer functionality
- Mobile responsiveness

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journey from wallet selection to DID creation
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **DID Management**: Update and deactivate existing DIDs
- **Export Options**: Download DID documents in various formats
- **Credential Integration**: Direct verifiable credential issuance
- **Multi-DID Support**: Manage multiple DIDs per wallet
- **Social Features**: Share DID information with contacts

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and code splitting
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline DID operations
- **Animation Enhancements**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility Audit**: Comprehensive accessibility testing
