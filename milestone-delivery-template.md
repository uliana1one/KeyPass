**Context**
This milestone delivers the foundational wallet-based login SDK for KeyPass, enabling seamless authentication with Polkadot wallets. The SDK provides a secure, user-friendly way for applications to integrate wallet-based login, with support for multiple wallet providers (Polkadot.js, Talisman, and WalletConnect) and comprehensive error handling. The implementation includes DID creation and verification, making it a complete solution for decentralized identity management. The architecture and protocols are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for future integration with additional identity providers and verification methods.

**Additional Information**
The SDK has been implemented with a focus on security, reliability, and developer experience. Key features include:

1. Multi-wallet support (Polkadot.js, Talisman, WalletConnect)
2. Comprehensive error handling with typed errors
3. DID creation and verification
4. Message signing and verification
5. TypeScript support with full type definitions
6. Extensive test coverage
7. Detailed documentation and integration guides

The implementation follows best practices for security and includes:
- Nonce-based message signing to prevent replay attacks
- Proper error handling and validation
- Timeout protection for wallet operations
- Type-safe interfaces and configurations
- Comprehensive test coverage with both Docker and CI environments
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Isolated testing environments using Docker containers

The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, with clear separation of concerns between:
- Wallet adapters for different providers
- DID management and verification
- Message signing and validation
- Protocol implementations for different identity standards

The protocols documentation details the supported standards and integration points, including:
- EIP-4361 (Sign-In with Ethereum) adaptation for Polkadot
- DID creation and resolution protocols
- Message signing and verification standards
- Integration with Polkadot's identity infrastructure

The SDK is ready for integration into Polkadot-based applications. The modular architecture allows for easy extension to support additional wallet providers and identity protocols in future milestones.
