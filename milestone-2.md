# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [KeyPass Application](https://github.com/uliana1one/KeyPass/blob/main/applications/keypass.md)
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context**
This milestone delivers the next phase of KeyPass: a full-featured DID Explorer dashboard, credential/SBT display, and zkProof credential demo, all integrated with the Polkadot ecosystem. The implementation demonstrates seamless wallet-based login, DID issuance, SBT minting, credential management, and private credential verification, with a focus on privacy, user control, and developer integration. The architecture and documentation have been expanded to support advanced identity, credential, and privacy flows, and to provide clear guidance for multiple integration approaches.

**Architecture Achievement**

### **Advanced Multi-Layer Architecture Implemented**
- **Core SDK Layer**: Authentication, wallet adapters, DID/credential/zkProof APIs, server verification
- **Frontend Implementation Layer**: DID Explorer wizard, credential/SBT dashboard, zkProof generator, professional UI components
- **Integration Flexibility**: Core SDK, example-based, and hybrid integration approaches, with clear documentation and code samples

**Enhanced Features Delivered:**
- **DID Explorer Dashboard**: Multi-step wizard for DID creation (fixed-stepper UI), DID document preview, advanced configuration, and wallet-based onboarding
- **Credential & SBT Dashboard**: Credential/SBT grid and card display, request wizard, privacy controls, revocation, and sharing
- **zkProof Credential Demo**: Stepper for credential selection, circuit choice, proof generation/verification (Semaphore, PLONK, Groth16), and privacy-preserving sharing
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All guides updated to reflect new features, integration patterns, and advanced flows
- **Production-Ready Examples**: React and Vanilla implementations with full credential and proof flows

**Production-Ready Features**
